<h2>LP2 Exercise 5</h2>

<a href="http://www.studyflight.com/attitudes-and-movements/" target="_blank" title="referencing website">ATTITUDES AND MOVEMENTS</a>
<br></br>
<h3>Objective</h3>
To teach:
<br></br>
(2)	How to produce those attitudes with movements
<br></br>
(3)	How to control the yaw
<br></br>

<p><p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
-	This is the fundamentals of flying (straight and level, turns, climbs, and descents)
<p></p>
<h3>Threshold Knowledge Test</h3>
-	What do you remember from the last flight?
-	Ask questions about the primary control surfaces (ailerons, elevators, and rudder) and what happens to the primary control surfaces when we move the control column and the rudder pedals
<p></p>
<h3>Essential Background Knowledge</h3>
-	Definition: VFR , Horizon(main reference & the line separates ground form sky), Attitudes & Movements , Cowling(Nose of aircraft)<br><br>
<h4>Movements: motion of the aircraft around 3 axes</h4>
<br></br>
<img src="movement.jpg">
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Pitch: around the lateral axis/ achieved by elevator (forward&back pressure)</li>
<li>Roll: around the longitudinal axis/ achieved by aileron (control column left/right)</li>
<li>Yaw: around the vertical(normal) axis/ achieved by rudder (rudder pedal left/right)</li>
</ol>
<br></br>
<h4>Attitudes: position of the aircraft relative to the horizon</h4>
<ol>
<li>Cruise attitude: wings are level (parallel to the horizon) & nose is slightly below the horizon (3finger gap)</li>
(used for straight and level flight, X-C, most of flying, and transition to flare)</li>
<li>Nose-up attitude: the nose is higher than cruise and the nose touches the horizon</li>
(used for takeoff, climb, and flare)
<li>Nose-down attitude: the nose is lower than cruise (7 fingers gap below the horizon)</li>
(used for descending)
<li>Bank attitude: wings are not level (not parallel with the ground)</li>
(Used for turning)
</ol>
<br></br>
<h3>How</h3>
<h4>Procedures</h4>

	Cruise Attitude	Nose-up Attitude	Nose-down Attitude	Bank Attitude
Entry	Wing=level(parallel to the horizon)
Nose=3fingers below the horzion	Wing = level
Nose = apply back pressure on control column	Wing = level
Nose = apply forward pressure on control column	Wing = move the control column left/right then neutralize
Maintain	Hold the control column (maintain gap)	Hold the control column	Hold the control column	Neutralize the aileron
Recovery		Apply forward pressure to bring the nose down	Apply back pressure to bring the nose up	Wing = move the control column opposite side then neutralize when wings are level
<p></p>
-	Adverse Yaw – control the yaw by rudder (Slipstream, Aileron drag)
<p></p>
-	Instruments
①	Cruise – AI & Altimeter & VSI
②	Nose-up – AI & Altimeter & VSI
③	Nose-down – AI & Altimeter & VSI
④	Bank – AI & HI & TC
⑤	Yaw – TC (step on the ball -> ball center)
<p></p>
-	Combinations
①	Nose up + bank
②	Nose down + bank
<p></p>
-	Safety
①	Transfer of control : “I have control” “You have control”
②	Scan for traffic: divide sky in 3sectors and scan each sector for several seconds
③	Report traffic: clock system (ex. Traffic 2 o clock), altitude, head-on, converging, climbing and descending
