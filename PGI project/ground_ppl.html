<ol>
<li id='bold'>Certificate of Registration (See sample Certificate of Registration in Part IV - Annex, p. 123)</li>
<ul>
	<li>What does the Certificate of Registration tell you?</li>
<span class='blue'>The Certificate of Registration gives the nationality and registration mark, aircraft manufacturer,
   model and serial number, the purpose, name and address of the owner, owner registration date, certificate issue date,
    and signature for the Minister of Transport</span>
	<li>How long is the Certificate of Registration valid? What invalidates it?</li>
<span class='blue'>The Certificate of Registration remains valid as long as the ownership does not change,
   or the owner's address does not change. The Certificate of Registration becomes invalid when the aircraft
    is destroyed or taken out of service permanently.<br>
Note: The registration of the airplane (ex. C-GFAS) does not change following a change of ownership.</span>
	<li>How long does the owner of an aircraft have to notify the Minister of Transport of a change of address?</li>
<span class='blue'>The owner has 7 days to complete the change of address information on the Certificate
  of Registration and mail it in.</span>
 <li>What is the procedure with respect to the Certificate of Registration when the aircraft is sold?</li>
<span class='blue'>To effect a change of ownership, the reverse side of the Certificate of Registration must be filled out and mailed to the Minister of Transport within 7 days. The pink copy remains with the aircraft and is valid for a maximum of 60 days or until the new Certificate of Registration is received, whichever comes first.
(If a new certificate is not received within 60 days, the aircraft is no longer considered registered)</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Certificate of Airworthiness (See sample Certificate of Airworthiness in Part IV - Annex, p. 123)</li>
<ul>
	<li>For how long is the original Certificate of Airworthiness valid?</li>
<span class='blue'>Indefinitely, if the aircraft continues to meet the conditions under which it was issued; that is,
   as long as the aircraft is maintained in accordance with the requirements of the controlling agency.<br>
Note: A Certificate of Airworthiness is issued to a specific aircraft, not to a person/owner.
Therefore, a change of address or ownership does not invalidate it.</span>
	<li>What temporarily invalidates the Certificate of Airworthiness?</li>
<span class='blue'>Temporary invalidation of the Certificate of Airworthiness is caused by:<br>
a. Failure to comply with Airworthiness Directives (AD).<br>
b. Failure to do required maintenance inspections at required intervals, unless on an extension.<br>
c. An action that contradicts the Pilot's Operating Handbook<br>
d. Any minor or major accident.<br>
e. Any unscheduled maintenance report (snag) written in the Journey Logbook.<br>
</br>
* Airworthiness Directives (AD) are notices issued by aircraft or engine manufacturers informing
of a defect or problem that include corrective measures. Once an AD has been complied with,
the AME (Aircraft Maintenance Engineer) must make the necessary entry in the Technical Logbook.<br>
** A good example is the Weight and Balance. If a pilot takes off with a weight greater than that allowed,
the Certificate of Airworthiness is invalid.</span>
	<li>How often must the Certificate of Airworthiness be re-validated?</li>
<span class='blue'>Once a year</span>
	<li>How is it re-validated?</li>
<span class='blue'>By submitting an Annual Airworthiness Information Report (see sample in Part IV - Annex, p.124)</span>
	<li>Is a Certificate of Airworthiness issued for amateur-built aircraft?</li>
<span class='blue'>No. Amateur-built aircraft are issued a Flight Permit.</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Weight and Balance Report (See sample Weight and Balance Report in Part IV - Annex, p. 125)</li>
<ul>
  <li>Define Basic Empty Weight (BEW)</li>
<span class='blue'>The Basic Empty Weight includes:<br>
a. Weight of the standard airplane (ie, airframe, engine, standard equipment, unusable fuel)<br>
b. All optional equipment.<br>
c. Full oil.</span>
  <li>Define maximum takeoff weight</li>
<span class='blue'>Maximum takeoff weight is the maximum weight approved for the start of the takeoff run.</span>
  <li>How does the maximum takeoff weight differ from the maximum ramp weight?</li>
<span class='blue'>The maximum ramp weight includes the fuel that will be used for start, taxi and run-up.
  Therefore, as a result of the fuel already burned, maximum takeoff weight will be less than maximum ramp weight.<br>
Note: Maximum ramp weight is usually not used for small aircraft.</span>

 <li>What is the difference between normal and utility categories?</li>
<span class='blue'>The utility category is solely for the purpose of training pilots in certain flight maneuvers and,
   therefore, is usually subject to some restrictions. In the normal category, maximum gross weight operations
    are permitted, but certain maneuvers, such as spins and steep turns, are prohibited.</span>
 <li>Where can the pilot learn of the category(ies) for which the aircraft is approved as well as any related limitations?</li>
<span class='blue'>This information is found in the Pilot's Operating Handbook.</span>
 <li>Is an aircraft considered airworthy if overloaded/ Why?</li>
<span class='blue'>No. Compliance with weight limitations is part of the airworthiness validity</span>
 <li>How often does an aircraft have to be re-weighed?</li>
<span class='blue'>Aircraft must be re-weighed and an amended Weight and Balance Report produced
  if a change in weight of more than 2% of the empty weight has occurred, or
  if the weight change cannot be measured (for example, as may occur if an aeroplane is re-painted).<br>
Note: If the weight of the aircraft exceeds 12,500 lbs, it must be re-weighed every 5 years.</span>
 <li>What important information is found on the original Weight and Balance Report that will not be found elsewhere?</li>
<span class='blue'>The following are found in the original Weight and Balance Report, and not found elsewhere:<br>
a. The date of manufacture of the aircraft.<br>
b. The actual unusable fuel.<br>
c. The amount of full oil.</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Journey Logbook</li>
<ul>
 <li>Does the Journey Logbook have to be carried on board for each flight?</li>
<span class='blue'>The answer is yes, but with one notable exception:<br>
  if the pilot does not plan to land and shut down at a location other than the departure base,
  the Journey Logbook need not be carried on board</span>
 <li>Are aircraft inspections based on air time or flight time?</li>
<span class='blue'>Aircraft inspections are based on air time</span>
 <li>What type of inspection schedule is the aircraft on?</li>
<span class='blue'>50-100-50-200 at 50 hour intervals (refer to Maintenance Control Manul)</span>
 <li>When was the last inspection done and which one was it?</li>
<span class='blue'>Refer to Journey Logbook</span>
 <li>When is the next inspection due?</li>
<span class='blue'>Refer to Journey Logbook</span>
 <li>If the inspection was due at 1,050 hours, can you fly the aircraft beyond that time? If yes, under what circumstances?</li>
<span class='blue'>No (refer to MCM)</span>
 <li>How do you know that an annual inspection has been carried out?</li>
<span class='blue'>Refer to Journey Logbook</span>
 <li>If a snag is reported in the Remarks section of the Journey Logbook, can you fly the aircraft? Is it airworthy?</li>
<span class='blue'>Under no circumstances is the aircraft legal to fly if any type of problem is written in the Remarks,
   unless an AME has checked it and signed it off</span>
<li>How do you correct an error in the Journey Logbook?</li>
<span class='blue'>All errors should be corrected with a single line through them. The correct information should then
   be entered. Errors must never be erased or masked with "liquid paper".<br>
Note: AII entries should be made in ink'</span>

 <li>How often must the compass be swung?</li>
<span class='blue'>The compass must be swung annually</span>
 <li>How do you verify that the compass has been swung?</li>
<span class='blue'>Refer to Journey Logbook</span>
 <li>When do you require an ELT?</li>
<span class='blue'>An ELT is required on board at all times unless the aircraft is operated within 25
  nautical miles of the departure aerodrome</span>
 <li>How often and by whom must the ELT be certified? Is an entry required in the Journey Logbook?</li>
<span class='blue'>An ELT must be certified once per year, by an avionics shop.
  An entry must be made in the Journey Logbook</span>
 <li>For how long is an ELT battery good?</li>
<span class='blue'>ELT batteries are good for two years from the date of manufacture</span>
 <li>At what time can you check if the ELT is operational?</li>
<span class='blue'>ELT operation can be checked during first five minutes past each hour for no more than five seconds.</span>
 <li>When was the last inspection of the pitot-static system performed? How often should it be done?</li>
<span class='blue'>he pitot-static system must be certified once every two year</span>
 <li>Once a Journey Logbook has been completely filled, how long must it be retained?</li>
<span class='blue'>For a period of not less than three years.</span>
 <li>Using the Journey Logbook, demonstrate that the aircraft is airworthy.</li>
<span class='blue'>When using the Journey Logbook to demonstrate that the aircraft is airworthy:<br>
a. Check if the maintenance inspections have been done.<br>
b. Check the last air time entry against the next “inspection due" air time.<br>
c. Check if the last compass swing was done within the past year.<br>
d. Check if the ELT was certified within the past year.<br>
e. Check to ensure that no "snags" are recorded in the Remarks section (for the aircraft to be airworthy,
any snag must have been signed off by an AME).<br>
f. Check if the pitot-static system has been certified within the past two years</span>
</ul>

<li id='bold'>Pilot’s Operating Handbook</li>
<ul>
<li> What type of information can be found in the Pilot's operating Handbook (POH)? Why do you think it is important to have it on board?</li>
<span class='blue'>The Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH), sometimes called the Aircraft Flight Manual (AFM),
   has all the pertinent information for the make and model of the aircraft. It allows you to research any
   information that might be needed while you are in the aircraft (power settings, emergency procedures,
   takeoff, cruise and landing performance tables, etc.).
   It also provides an equipment list detailing all the equipment available for a particular model of aircraft
   and specifies whether each item of equipment is required, optional, etc.</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Crew licenses and Medical Certificates</li>
<ul>
 <li>List the documents any flight crew member must carry on board while operating an aircraft</li>
<span class='blue'>There are three documents that any flight crew member must carry on board while operating an aircraft:<br>
a. License or permit<br>
b. Valid medical<br>
c. Radiotelephone Operator's Certificate (if operating a radio)</span>
 <li>What class of medical is required for a private pilot license and for how long is it valid?</li>
<span class='blue'>A Category III medical is required. It is valid for 60months up to 40 years of age.
  Over age 40, it is valid for 24 months</span>
 <li>What class of medical is required for a commercial pilot license and for how long is it valid?</li>
<span class='blue'>A Category I medical is required. It is valid for 12months up to 40 years of age.
   Over age 40, it is valid for 6 months.</span>
 <li>When does your medical expire?</li>

 <li>For how long is the Radiotelephone Operator’s Certificate valid?</li>
<span class='blue'>A Radiotelephone Operator's Certificate is valid for life.</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Proof of Insurance</li>
<ul>
 <li>Does proof of insurance for the aircraft have to be on board for each flight?</li>
<span class='blue'>Yes. Proof of insurance must be carried on board for all flights except for commercial aircraft.</span>
</ul>
<li id='bold'>Additional questions</li>
<ul>
 <li>May the Technical Logbook be carried on board the aircraft?</li>
<span class='blue'>The Technical Logbook must not be carried on board aircraft at the same time as the Journey Logbook.</span>
 <li>How long must Technical Logbooks be kept once they are full?</li>
<span class='blue'>They must be kept until such time as the aircraft is no longer registered</span>
 <li>Should a Radio Station License be carried on board during flight?</li>
<span class='blue'>No. It is no longer required for flights in Canada. However,
  a valid radio station license issued by Industry Canada is required for international flights.</span>
