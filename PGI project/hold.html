<h2>Hold</h2>

Holds
Objective
	To teach VOR holding patterns (hold at HUH)
	To determine wind direction and apply appropriate corrections
Motivation
	Why/when:
①	whenever an aircraft is cleared to a fix other than destination airport and delay is expected, holding instruction will be given
②	poor weather
③	runway unavailable to land
④	emergency (completing checklist)
Essential Background Knowledge
	types of holding pattern:
①	course reversal holding pattern
②	arrival holding pattern to control traffic
③	missed approach holding pattern
	types of holding entry:
①	Direct entry
②	Parallel entry:
③	Teardrop(offset) entry:
	Normal holding pattern is right hand
	Inbound leg must be 1min below 14,000’
	Inbound leg timing is counted when the wings are level from turning
	Outbound leg timing is counted when aircraft is abeam the fix
Holding Clearance
A holding clearance issued by ATC will include at least the following items:
•	a clearance to the holding fix
•	the direction to hold from the holding fix
•	a specified radial, course, or inbound track
•	if DME is used, the DME distances at which the fix end and outbound end turns are to be commenced (hold between [number of miles] and [number of miles]). If the outbound DME is not specified by ATC, pilots are expected adhere to the standard holding pattern timing procedures above
•	the altitude or FL to be maintained
•	the time to expect further clearance or an approach clearance or the time to leave the fix in the event of a communications failure

Procedures
-	Standard holding pattern

-	Holding pattern thumb method to find out the entry type:
(Reference video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbIw6kdytnU)

-	Holding entry procedures

①	Sector 1 (parallel entry):
	2 left turns & 1 right turn
	1st left turn should be the outbound heading after the fix and fly 1 min outbound leg
	2nd left turn should be to intercept the inbound radial
	Right turn should be performed when the flag changes to “from”

②	Sector 2 (teardrop entry):
	Upon reaching the fix, turn 30˚ towards parallel side and fly 1 min leg on that heading
	Upon reaching 1min, turn right to intercept inbound radial
③	Sector 3 (Direct entry):
	Upon reaching the fix, turn right to outbound heading and fly the holding pattern


Safety

- Holding speeds
- Holding endurance
