<h2>VOR Approach</h2>

Objective
-	To learn how to conduct VOR approach
-	To learn the standard procedure turn and how to conduct it
-	To learn the types of procedure turns
-	To learn how to read the instrument approach chart (IAP)
-	Introduction of circling approach (at the last VOR approach)
Motivation
-	Why VOR approach:  VOR is one of the most widely used non-precision approach types. VOR approaches use VOR facilities both on and off the airport to establish approaches and include the use of a wide variety of equipment, such as DME and TACAN. VOR approaches can provide MDAs as low as 250 feet above the runway
-	Why Procedure turns: PTs are also called “course reversal”. Some approach procedures do not permit straight-in approaches unless pilots are being radar vectored. In these situations, pilots are required to complete a procedure turn or other course reversal, generally within 10NM of the PT fix, to establish the aircraft inbound on the intermediate or final approach segment.
Threshold Knowledge Test
-	How to find a position
-	How to track inbound or outbound from the station
-	How to intercept and track inbound or outbound from the station
Essential Background Knowledge
-	Non-precision approach:
A non-precision approach is an instrument approach and landing which utilizes lateral guidance but does not utilize vertical guidance. (ICAO Annex 6)

-	Types of Procedure turns:


When procedure turns should not be performed:
1.	When being radar vectored
2.	When on a timed approach from a holding fix
3.	When the chart specifies “NoPT”




Procedures:
45/180 procedure turn procedure:
①	Track inbound to the station directly (using VOR #1)
②	Set VOR #2 on outbound radial for procedure turn (ex., if the final course is 073, set 253 on TOP)
③	After the passage of the station, perform 5 T’s
④	Intercept outbound radial using VOR #2 (= reciprocal radial of the course) (ex., 253 radial)
⑤	Track outbound on 253-radial for 1 min and set VOR #1 to the final course 073 on TOP
⑥	After 1min outbound, set heading bug to 208˚ and fly 1min outbound on that heading
⑦	After flying outbound on 208˚ heading, turn right to reciprocal heading of 028˚ and intercept the final course (= make the needle center)
⑧	Set the VOR #2 on the final course (ex, 073 on TOP and TO flag) for redundancy

VOR Approach:
①	Maintain above 2000’ until “YVR” VOR
②	After the passage of the “YVR” VOR station, perform 5T’s
③	Set the time, if the approach speed is 100kts, it will take about 3min 6 seconds from “YVR” VOR to the MAP (also refer the DME, MAP is 5.1 DME from “YVR” VOR)
④	Set heading but on missed approach heading
⑤	Go down until MDA and perform missed approach at the MAP

Non precision MAP fixes are identified in a number of ways:
•	Fixes identified by additional terrestrial Navaids eg intersections between the localizer and radial directions from other Navaid beacons like VORs, NDBs, etc..
•	Fixes identified by DME slant ranges.
•	Fixes identified by flying a linear course from an identified FAF at a specific airspeed for a specific time.
•	Fixes identified by area navigation systems.
•	Fixes identified by specific GNSS waypoints (RNAV GPS).

Safety
-	Always fly to the TOP
