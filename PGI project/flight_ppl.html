	   Pre-Flight Inspection
   </button>
   <div class="content">
     <p>
       <h2>Pre-Flight Inspection</h2>
       <h3>Description</h3>
       The candidate will determine that the aeroplane is ready for the intended flight and, as can reasonably be
       determined by pre-flight inspection, confirmed to be airworthy. The external and internal checks must
       cover at least all of the items specified by the manufacturer. All required equipment and documents will
       be located and safely stowed. Visual checks for fuel quantity, proper grade of fuel, fuel contamination
       and oil level will be carried out in accordance with the POH/AFM. If aircraft design precludes a visual
       check of fuel levels, fuel chits, fuel logs or other credible procedures may be used to confirm the amount
       of fuel actually on board. The candidate will state the available flight time at the intended cruising speed
       with the actual fuel on board.
       After the candidate has completed the pre-flight inspection, questions relating to the flight test aircraft will
       be asked. <strong><u>The candidate should be able to explain what appropriate action would be taken if an
       unsatisfactory item were detected or described by the examiner during the pre-flight inspection.</u></strong> The
       candidate should demonstrate knowledge of the consequences if such items were undetected.
       <br><strong>Note: The external and internal checks must at least cover all of the items specified by the manufacturer.
       The candidate will conduct an oral passenger safety briefing. If the candidate omits the passenger safety
       briefing, the examiner will ask the candidate to provide a briefing.</strong></br>
       <h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
       Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to:
       <ul>
    <li>use an orderly procedure to inspect the aeroplane including at least those items listed by the
       manufacturer or aeroplane owner;</li>
    <li>identify and verify switches, circuit breakers/fuses, and spare fuses;</li>

	<li><h2>Forced approach</h2></li>
  <h3>Aim</h3>
  To plan, manage and safely carry out a successful approach in the event of an engine failure to a selected
  touchdown zone in the first 1/3 of a suitable landing area.
  <h3>Description</h3>
  Engine failure will be simulated from 3,000 feet AGL without advance warning by the examiner by
  closing the throttle to idle or by bringing the power lever to flight idle and declaring “Simulated Engine
  Failure”. While accomplishing the required emergency procedures, the candidate will be expected to use
  good decision-making and demonstrate the competence to perform a safe gliding approach to a suitable
  landing area so that a safe landing could be made if the approach were continued to the ground. Unless
  the intent is to execute an actual landing on a suitable surface, an overshoot will be carried out when
  requested by the examiner at an operationally safe height above ground.
  <h3><u>A. Control/Approach</u></h3>
  <h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
  Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to:
  <ul>
  <li>control the aeroplane and initially establish the recommended best glide speed (+10/-5 knots);</li>
  <li>specify a suitable landing area and a touchdown zone in the first 1/3 of the landing area, considering
  wind conditions, terrain, obstacles and other factors;</li>
  <li>fly an organized approach while adjusting the flight profile to arrive at key points at the desired
  height and position;</li>
  <li>fly an approach towards the selected touchdown zone with a level of precision that would avoid
  touching down more than 1,000 feet (300 meters) beyond the end of the selected touchdown zone;</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li><strong>Note 1:</strong> An approach that would have resulted in touching down more than 1,000 feet beyond the
  end of the selected touchdown zone in the first 1/3 of the landing area will be considered a
  major error and assessed with a mark of “2” or less.</li>
  <li><strong>Note 2:</strong> After initially establishing the recommended glide speed, the candidate may vary the airspeed
  and flight profile, as required to achieve a successful and safe approach, without exceeding any
  aircraft limitations.</li>
  <li><strong>Note 3:</strong> A change of field is acceptable from an altitude or point in the approach where a landing could
  still have been made on the originally chosen landing site.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
  <h3><u>B. Cockpit Management</u></h3>
  <h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
  Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to:
  <ul>
  <li>complete the basic vital actions from memory ;</li>
  <li>follow-up with a placard or a checklist for ‘Engine Failure In Flight’ emergency procedures, if time
  permits;</li>
  <li>simulate an appropriate radio call, if time permits; and</li>
  <li>perform a passenger emergency safety review.</li>
  <br><strong>Note: The candidate is expected to clear the engine at appropriate intervals during the descent. In very
  cold conditions, it is acceptable for the candidate to configure the aeroplane by lowering some
  flap and us</strong></br>
</ul>
	<li><h2>Precautionary landing</h2></li>
  <h3>Aim</h3>
  To safely evaluate an unfamiliar aerodrome or landing area as a prospective place to land
  <h3>Description</h3>
  The examiner will outline a scenario requiring a landing. Scenarios may include a landing at an
  aerodrome of unknown condition or an off-field landing due to a deteriorating condition. The candidate
  must select a suitable landing area, determine the landing path, determine the appropriate precautionary
  procedure to be used and must use a planned procedure to fly an accurate approach. While an actual
  landing may not be required, the final approach flown should be such that a successful landing could have
  been accomplished in the pre-selected touchdown zone.
  <h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
  Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to:
  <ul>
    <li>select a suitable aerodrome, airstrip or other suitable area on which a safe landing could be made;</li>
      <li>comply with circuit procedures at an aerodrome;</li>
        <li>make appropriate radio calls (simulated or actual), as applicable;</li>
          <li>evaluate the wind conditions, landing surface and obstacles;</li>
            <li>establish a circuit at an appropriate distance from the runway, airstrip or landing area;</li>

                  <li>configure and trim the aeroplane for the low-level inspection at an airspeed adjusted for existing
  conditions, as recommended in the POH/AFM, while in straight and level flight;</li>
    <li>execute a stabilized approach for the low-level inspection at the recommended airspeed (+10/–5
  knots);</li>
    <li>overfly the landing area in stabilized level flight at a safe height above obstacles for both the
  approach and departure and at an airspeed that will permit an effective assessment of surface
  conditions;</li>
    <li>determine the suitability of the intended landing surface;</li>
      <li>select the most suitable touchdown zone;</li>
        <li>indicate the type of landing to be used;</li>
          <li>complete appropriate checks; and</li>
            <li>perform a stabilized final approach in a manner that would permit touching down within the
  selected touchdown zone.</li>
</ul>
  <br><strong>Note: The candidate must communicate the intended height for the low-level inspection and explain the
  operational necessity for any variation from recommended speeds, such as for gusty or crosswind
  conditions.</strong></br>
	<li><h2>Diversion</h2></li>
<h3>Aim</h3>
To safely carry out a diversion to a suitable alternate destination using mental in-flight planning, dead
reckoning, map reading and pilotage.
<h3>Description</h3>
In response to a scenario presented by the examiner, the candidate will demonstrate the proficiency to
select a suitable alternate destination that is within the actual or a simulated fuel range of the aeroplane.
The candidate will carry out a diversion towards the selected destination, or alternatively in the interest of
flight test efficiency, towards another destination selected by the examiner. Rulers, notched pencils,
protractors, devices such as ForeFlight, computers or radio navigation aids will not be used for this item.
<strong><u>The candidate is expected to initiate the diversion without undue delay by quickly determining a
track to follow, an approximate heading and an approximate time enroute to avoid the need to loiter
in a holding pattern.</u></strong> (This will require extensive ground training and practice to improve the
candidate’s competency to quickly determine a track to follow, an approximate heading and an
approximate time enroute in order to avoid the need to loiter in a holding pattern.)
The examiner will specify an initial altitude to fly. When practicable, a part or all of the diversion should
be conducted at a height of between 500 and 1000 feet above ground or at the minimum safe altitude,
whichever is higher. The candidate may change altitudes to suit the topography or the scenario and is
expected to communicate intentional altitude changes to the examiner. Estimated enroute and arrival
times may be approximate but with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
<strong><u>The examiner will assess the candidate’s proficiency to proceed toward an alternate destination by using
dead- reckoning or by following a series of geographic features such as roads, railways or rivers, where
they are available.</u></strong> The diversion will be continued until at least the stage where the aeroplane is
established on the proposed track to the alternate or is following a suitable geographic feature; in a manner
demonstrating that arrival at the destination is predictable.
Note: Radio navigation aids or GPS are not to be used during the execution of this item. A paper
VNC chart is to be used.
<h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to
<ul>
 <li>perform the following tasks expeditiously:
   <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
 <li>identify and record present position;
  <li>select an appropriate alternate destination;
 <li>estimate an initial heading to fly direct, based on a track line; OR
<li>select a series of geographical references that would lead to the destination;
 <li>estimate an approximate time enroute to the alternate destination; and
 <li>estimate an approximate available flight time that will remain with the fuel on board upon
arrival at the destination (E.g.: 2 hours+15 minutes);
</ul>
 <li>intercept the proposed track and divert toward the alternate destination;
 <li>identify the highest Maximum Elevation Figure (MEF) along the selected route and determine a
minimum safe altitude for the actual route;
 <li>select an aircraft configuration and airspeed appropriate for the actual or simulated conditions, if
those conditions include poor visibility (for optimum “See and Avoid”);
 <li>provide an initial ETA when setting heading and confirm or revise that ETA while enroute;
 <li>maintain the selected airspeed (±10 knots) and selected headings, when dead-reckoning (±10°);
 <li>maintain declared altitudes (±200 feet);
 <li>simulate communication with ATS to inform of intention to divert.

  <h3><u>Approach and Landing</u></h3>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  For the short or soft-field approach and landing, the examiner will clearly specify the simulated surface
  conditions, obstacles on approach, landing threshold and length of surface available to the candidate.
  Should the candidate realize, prior to the landing flare, that a short-field landing could not be achieved
  in the intended touchdown zone; an overshoot for a second attempt is acceptable.
  <h3>Performance Criteria</h3>
Assessment will be based on the candidate’s proficiency to:
<ul>
 <li>review passenger safety (Example; seat belt secure, door locked);</li>
 <li>consider the wind conditions and actual or simulated landing surface and obstacles;</li>
 <li>select the most suitable touchdown zone and specify a touchdown point in consideration of the
obstacles to be cleared;</li>
 <li>execute the initial approach using recommended airspeeds and configurations;</li>
 <li>fly a stabilized final approach descent profile that safely clears any actual or simulated obstacle, and
results in the appropriate configuration and one of the following (VREF) speeds at a height of 50 feet
above the threshold:</li>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>the recommended final approach speed (+10/–5 knots); or</li>
   <li> 1.3 VSO (+10/–5 knots); or</li>
  <li> the minimum safe speed for existing conditions, such as gusty or crosswind conditions.</li>
</ul>
 <li>maintain crosswind correction and directional control throughout the approach and landing;</li>
 <li>make smooth, timely and correct control applications during the landing flare and touchdown;</li>
 <li>touch down at the specified touchdown point (+200/–50 feet) in accordance with the POH/AFM or
best accepted practice for the aeroplane type;</li>
 <li>touch down with no side drift, and with the longitudinal axis aligned with and within 15 feet of the
centre of the landing surface;</li>
 <li>apply brakes, without excessive lockup or skidding and stop safely in the shortest distance;</li>

 <li>complete appropriate checks.</li>
</ul>
<br><strong>Note: Abrupt decent after clearing an obstacle will be assessed as a “2” or less. (“Chop and Drop” is
not stable.)</strong></br>

<li>specify a GO/NO GO decision point to the examiner;</li>
<li>check for traffic and taxi onto the take-off surface at a safe speed while keeping the nose wheel as
light as possible and, without stopping, advance the throttle smoothly to take-off power (ATC
instructions must be complied with);</li>
<li>confirm that take-off power has been achieved;</li>
<li>maintain directional control during the take-off roll;</li>
<li>establish and maintain a pitch attitude that will effectively and efficiently transfer the weight of the
aeroplane from the wheels to the wings;</li>
<li>lift off at the slowest airspeed commensurate with safety in existing conditions;</li>
<li>remain in ground effect and accelerate to VX or VY, as obstacles may dictate;</li>
<li>establish the pitch attitude for the recommended climb speed and maintain that speed (+10/–5
knots);</li>
<li>retract the landing gear (where applicable) at a safe height;</li>
<li>retract flaps (where applicable) at a safe height and above the recommended minimum speed;</li>
<li>maintain take-off power to a safe height, then, where applicable, set climb power (±0.5” MP, ±50
RPM);</li>
<li>maintain directional control and apply drift correction in the climb;</li>
<li>complete appropriate checks.</li>
